#
# Description
#     Setup file for CGAL (& boost) include/libraries.
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/cshrc
#
#     If using system-wide installations, use the following settings:
#
#         boost_version=boost-system
#         cgal_version=cgal-system
#
#     If using a central installation:
#         - specify boost-system / cgal-system
#         - provide full paths for BOOST_ARCH_PATH / CGAL_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     When building OpenFOAM, any changes made here MUST be made in the
#     equivalent config.sh version too, since that is the one which will
#     be used during the build process.
