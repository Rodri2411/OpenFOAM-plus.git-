# Description
#     Setup file for VTK (and MESA)
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/cshrc
#
#     The library path is only adjusted when the paths specified here
#     actually exist at the time of sourcing.
#
# Note
#     When building OpenFOAM, any changes made here MUST be made in the
#     equivalent config.sh version too, since that is the one which will
#     be used during the build process.
#
# It is recommended to use VTK sources from ParaView (5.0.1 or later)
#
# See BuildIssues.txt about problems that can be encountered when using
# the 'plain' VTK sources.
