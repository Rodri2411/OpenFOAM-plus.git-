#
# Description
#     Setup file for CGAL (& boost) include/libraries.
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
#
#     To disable its use:
#         boost_version=boost-none
#         cgal_version=cgal-none
#
#     For system-wide installations:
#         boost_version=boost-system
#         cgal_version=cgal-system
#
#     For central installations not located under ThirdParty:
#       1. use boost-system / cgal-system
#       2. and provide full paths for BOOST_ARCH_PATH / CGAL_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     When _foamAddLib is unset (eg, called from makeCGAL):
#       - boost_version / cgal_version variables are retained.
#       - the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not adjusted.
#
#     Can also disable by renaming/removing this file or by creating an empty
#     file with the same name at a user or site location.
