# Description
#     Setup file for VTK (and MESA)
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
#
#     The library path is only adjusted when the paths specified here
#     actually exist at the time of sourcing.
#
# Note
#     When _foamAddLib is unset
#         - the vtk_version, mesa_version variables are retained.
#           (for future integration into ThirdParty build)
#
# It is recommended to use VTK sources from ParaView (5.0.1 or later)
#
# See BuildIssues.txt about problems that can be encountered when using
# the 'plain' VTK sources.
