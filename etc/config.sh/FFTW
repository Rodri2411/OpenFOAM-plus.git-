#
# Description
#     Setup for FFTW include/libraries (usually ThirdParty installation).
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
#
#     To disable its use:               fftw_version=fftw-none
#     For system-wide installations:    fftw_version=fftw-system
#
#     For central installations not located under ThirdParty:
#       1. use fftw-system
#       2. and provide full path for FFTW_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     When _foamAddLib is unset (eg, called from makeFFTW):
#       - fftw_version variable is retained.
#       - LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not adjusted.
#
#     Can also disable by renaming/removing this file or by creating an empty
#     file with the same name at a user or site location.
