# File
#     etc/config.sh/gperftools
#
# Description
#     Setup file for gperftools binaries and libraries.
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
#
#     If using system-wide installations, use the following settings:
#
#         gperftools_version=gperftools-system
#
#     If the system gperftools is unusable (eg, too old) and you don't
#     have or want a ThirdParty installation:
#
#         gperftools_version=gperftools-none
#
#     If using a central installation, but not located under ThirdParty:
#         - specify gperftools-system
#         - provide full paths for GPERFTOOLS_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     When _foamAddLib is unset (eg, called from makeGperftools):
#         - gperftools_version variable are retained.
#         - the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH are not adjusted.
