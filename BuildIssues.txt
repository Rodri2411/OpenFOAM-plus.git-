OpenFOAM-v1612+
==================
Known Build Issues
==================

--------------
Intel Compiler
--------------

  Since OpenFOAM uses C++11, a fairly recent version is required.

  The Intel compiler - icc (ICC) 17.0.0 20160721 - has a bug that
  will result in these types of error messages.

    MatrixSpaceI.H(492): error: no instance of overloaded function
    "Foam::MatrixSpace<Form, Cmpt, Mrows, Ncols>::Block<SubTensor,
    BRowStart, BColStart>::operator=" matches the specified type


  There is a update patch for the icc compiler to address this bug.


---
VTK
---

If using the runTimePostProcessing to create on-the-fly images, you
can either simply just compile ParaView-5.0.1 and these libraries will
be used.

If you decide to use a separate VTK compilation (for example for
off-screen rendering), it is advisable to reuse the VTK libraries that
are provided with ParaView-5.0.1, by making an appropriate symlink
prior to using makeVTK. This doesn't just reduce diskspace, but works
much better than using the VTK-7.1.0.tar file.

Building runTimePostProcessing with the 'plain' VTK-7.1.0 libraries
generally works, but yields odd error and unpleasant looking errors
when exiting:

    symbol lookup error: .../linux64Gcc/VTK-7.1.0/lib/libvtkCommonExecutionModel-7.1.so.1:
    undefined symbol: _ZN33vtkFilteringInformationKeyManager13ClassFinalizeEv

    symbol lookup error: .../linux64Gcc/VTK-7.1.0/lib/libvtkCommonDataModel-7.1.so.1:
    undefined symbol: _ZN49vtkInformationQuadratureSchemeDefinitionVectorKeyD1Ev
